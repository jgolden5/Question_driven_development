# Question_driven_development Version 8 Protcol (8P)

## 8 Rules:
1. Every complete library must have 8 complete terms—no more, no less
2. Every complete term must have 8 complete questions—no more, no less (note that there is no rule against using AI to generate _questions_ simply as a place to start)
3. Every complete question may only have 1 final answer (if there are more or less, the question is incomplete)
4. Any of these rules may be changed at any time, but just like the questions and terms, there may not be any more (or less) than 8 at any one time. So if I want to add one rule, I must remove another, and if I want to remove one rule, I must replace it with another. Thus we allow our 8 rules to be dynamic when improvements present themselves, while also remaining static in practice
5. Questions in QDD should only be asked with the intention of A) solving the problem at hand, or B) clarifying concepts relevant to the problem/topic at hand in order to reduce the number of future problems, and regardless they must be C) 8 words long or less
6. Answers in QDD must be A) my own words having passed through my own brain, B) helpful information, and C) 8 sentences or less, where each sentence is 8 words or less
7. I am encouraged to add questions and answers to my terms often, and even add new terms to my libraries, if that which I am adding is more valuable than that which I am replacing. This is the vision which empowers 8P—the idea that my quality of information and understanding can constantly increase while keeping my resulting knowledge base simple, relevant, and easy to navigate and improve
8. It is wise to use version control with QDD 8P in case I decide I prefer a recently deleted item (question, answer, term, or rule)
