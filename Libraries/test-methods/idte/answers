What types of force exist with IDTE tests? Insertion force, force required for catheter entry. Track force, force to move catheter along path|track. Push efficiency, force efficiency across distal|proximal tips.
Why is the IDTE called the IDTE? Interventional device, for minimally invasive devices like catheters. Testing equipment, it's equipment that tests things. It's equipment that tests interventional devices. BDPI and IDTE share the same 'I' acronym.
How do Ground Fault Interrupters (GFI's) work? Constantly checks if in and out currents mismatch. Stops curcuit flow at the very slightest mismatch. This tripping occurs faster than a hearbeat. Its purpose is to prevent electrocution. This can prevent electrocution when dealing with water.
What are the different parts of the IDTE? Roller assembly, guides catheters|guidewires through a simulated path. Tracking tray, simulated anatomical pathway. Roller rail, motorized rails that move the catheter. Sheath clamp, secures proximal end during simulated-use testing. Iris, grips and stabilizes proximal end of catheter. Calibration cables, fine-tune accuracy of measurement systems (calibration). Compact-trackability-distal-load-cell-assembly, load cell measuring distal forces across path.
