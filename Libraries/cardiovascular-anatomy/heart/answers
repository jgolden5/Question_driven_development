What's the difference between cardiovascular and endovascular? Cardiovascular means the whole heart system. Endovascular are minimally invasive procedures inside blood vessels. Pta catheters are specifically endovascular devices. Open-heart surgery is a non-endovascular operation. Endovascular system is a subset of the cardiovascular. Scalpels, sutures, and heart-lung machine are NON-endovascular.
