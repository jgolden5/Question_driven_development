What is the git working tree? where file/directory changes can be made, and it sits alongside a git directory, which is a hidden directory called .git which manages the repo's metadata and object database; in other words, the working tree is everything that's NOT in the .git folder that can be changed by the user and is therefore tracked using git version history unless explicitly excluded using the .gitignore file
