What does it mean when a file descriptor points to a file? programs can interact with a file's content using said file as input and/or output depending on the direction of the angle bracket(s) following the exec command and file descriptor number/variable name
What happens when a fifo reads into itself indefinitely? that actually is not possible, because fifos are by their very name, first-in first-out, which means they are single direction only, unlike a web socket which is full duplex (bidirectional); what this means is that I couldn't possibly run something through a fifo an infinite number of times when the input of one depends on the output of another bidirectionally--only if the direction is fixed
Why are fifos in bash named for first in first out? fifos are made to handle multiple pieces of data and ensure they get sent at the right time
What's the difference between sourcing and running a bash script? that running a script runs said script in a new and separate subshell, whereas sourcing a script executes the contents of the script  directly in the current shell environment, meaning all the variables and functions inside the script remain accessible after the script is sourced ('source script.sh' or '. script.sh'), but not simply if the script is run ('./script.sh', 'file/path/script.sh', or 'bash script.sh')
