Yes, it IS possible for fifos to create messy race conditions when used with '&', because if read and/or write operations to/from fifos are sent to the background, one might wrread before the other has finished writing, or vice versa; to work around this, I should consider looking into the bash 'wait' command.
Yes, I CAN run out of fifo inodes faster than I would run out of any other inodes--if you are creating more fifos than you are multiple files; other than that, fifos take up inodes the same as any other file.
With fifos, the wait command plays the role of making sure that a process that is either writing to or reading from a fifo gets completed before moving beyond a certain point, thus preventing race condition issues.
