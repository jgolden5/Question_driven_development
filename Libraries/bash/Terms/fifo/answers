Is it possible for fifos to create messy race conditions when used with '&'? yes, if read and/or write operations to/from fifos are sent to the background, one might wrread before the other has finished writing, or vice versa; to work around this, I should consider looking into the bash 'wait' command
Can I run out of fifo inodes faster than I would run out of any other inodes? yes, if you are creating more fifos than you are multiple files; other than that, fifos take up inodes the same as any other file
What role can the wait command play with fifos? making sure that a process that is either writing to or reading from a fifo gets completed before moving beyond a certain point, thus preventing race condition issues
What's the difference between mkfifo and mknod? that mkfifo can only make fifos, whereas mknod can make many different file types, and provides the user with greater control and low-level access
What role can the trap command play with fifos? executing a certain command when a certain signal is received (like EXIT, SIGTERM, or SIGINT, for example)
