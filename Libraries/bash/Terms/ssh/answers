How does a user prove their identity to a remote machine in order to use ssh? having an ssh key pair, which consists of a private (only the user sees it) and public key
What are some of the most useful ssh options? -p, which connects to a particular port; -i, which allows you to use a particular private key for authentication and is helpful if you have multiple ssh keys; and -l, which lets you specify a username instead of user@hostname, user hostname
How does tcp forwarding work? acting as a redirector on a network device, where incoming connections on a specific port are automatically directed to a different IP address and port, allowing access to a device on a private network from the outside by basically masking its location with the public ip address of the forwarding device
What does it mean when standard input gets redirected to come from /dev/null (-n option)? the terminal will expect no input
What is openSSH? an open source implementation of ssh, so openSSH is to ssh kind of like the GNU project is to gnu
What is an ssh tunnel? a secure method for transporting data over an encrypted connection between 2 hosts on a private network (aka, via port forwarding)
What are rsa and dsa keys? encryption algorithms that use public and private keys to secure data and digital signatures; specifically, rsa is used for secure data and encryption, and dsa is used for checking the authenticity of the message by generating and verifying signatures
