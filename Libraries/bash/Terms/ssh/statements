A user proves their identity to a remote machine in order to use ssh by having an ssh key pair, which consists of a private (only the user sees it) and public key.
Some of the most useful ssh options are -p, which connects to a particular port; -i, which allows you to use a particular private key for authentication and is helpful if you have multiple ssh keys; and -l, which lets you specify a username instead of user@hostname, user hostname.
How does tcp forwarding work? acting as a redirector on a network device, where incoming connections on a specific port are automatically directed to a different IP address and port, allowing access to a device on a private network from the outside by basically masking its location with the public ip address of the forwarding device.
When standard input gets redirected to come from /dev/null (-n option), it means that the terminal will expect no input.
OpenSSH is an open source implementation of ssh, so openSSH is to ssh kind of like the GNU project is to gnu.
An ssh tunnel is a secure method for transporting data over an encrypted connection between 2 hosts on a private network (aka, via port forwarding).
Rsa and dsa keys are encryption algorithms that use public and private keys to secure data and digital signatures; specifically, rsa is used for secure data and encryption, and dsa is used for checking the authenticity of the message by generating and verifying signatures.
