What rules will most positively affect my life? Simple rules followed beat complex rules ignored. Love God with whole heart, soul, and mind. Love my neighbor as myself. Treat my covenants as promises with God. Work earns play, play fuels work. What doesn't challenge you, doesn't change you. Good times ALWAYS follow bad times. True net worth = people I served.
