I figure out what the next step is when solving a hard problem I've never faced before by finding the point where what I do understand and what I don't understand meet, and bcontending for that zone to make more and more of it area that I DO understand, but one small 8-minute piece at a time.
I find out what I do and don't understand about a problem by clearly defining the problem, gathering information, and asking clarifying questions.
I find out what I do and don't understand about a problem by asking why 5 times to uncover underlying causes of everything.
I should ask for help when I have spent AT LEAST 1 hour on a problem AFTER first getting noticeably frustrated enough to really want to ask for help--that's when I need to resist the urge to ask for help immediately, and instead push myself for a little bit longer so that I make sure I'm strengthening my own mind by pushing it to solve harder and harder problems; even though this time is the most unpleasant, it is also the time when I grow the most.
