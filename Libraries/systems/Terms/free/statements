Mac doesn't have the free command because despite sharing many unix tools, mac does prefer to do their own thing still and use their own separate tools sometimes.
Something that free can do that vmstat cannot is free is more of a quick snapshot, while vmstat does dynamic observation of memory usage.
Disk caching is a memory feature which stores data that was recently accessed from a disk to a cache.
Something that free can do that vmstat cannot is take more of a quick snapshot, whereas vmstat is dynamic, in other words, free is to vmstat kind of like ps is to top.
I would only display available memory output from free command by running: free -h | cut -c 1-7,40-50.
I would track my memory usage, update it every 2 seconds, repeated 5 times by running: free -s 2 -c 5.
I only display total memory usage by running: free -h | grep Mem: | awk '{print $1, $2}'.
