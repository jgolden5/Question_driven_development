How would I figure out which file in a directory is consuming the most space using the du command? running: du -h /path/to/directory/* | sort -hr
How would I summarize disk usage for a directory without showing subdirectory details? running: du /path/to/directory -hs
How do I exclude specific files or directories from du output? running: du | grep -v exclude/this/path
How do I display disk usage for files only? running: find /path/to/search/dir -type f -exec du -h {} +
How would I get disk usage of subdirectories WITHOUT getting file disk usage? running: find /path/to/directory -type d -exec du -h {} +
