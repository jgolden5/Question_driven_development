How would I figure out which file in a directory is consuming the most space using the du command?
How would I summarize disk usage for a directory without showing subdirectory details?
How do I exclude specific files or directories from du output?
How do I display disk usage for files only?
How would I get disk usage of subdirectories WITHOUT getting file disk usage?
