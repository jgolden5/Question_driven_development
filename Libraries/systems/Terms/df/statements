1-3 keywords that should come to mind when I think of df are mounted devices' disk.
The df command views the amount of disk space currently being used and available on all mounted devices on my computer.
Yes, the df command DOES only check disk space on mounted devices because that is what this command does.
I would show ONLY the filesystem names and their mountpoints using the df command by running: df | cut -c 1-15 -c 79- (in macOS).
I would write a one-liner df command to display the available disk space on all mounted file systems in gigabytes, sorted by size by running the following command: df --block-size=1G | sort -k 2 | tac (linux only for tac).
I would check disk usage across ALL partitions using the df command by running: df -h --total | tail -1 | sed -E 's/([^ ]+)( *)([^ ]+).*/1: 3/' (use -c instead of --total and -r instead of -E for macOS).
I would check the disk usage for only one specific mount point by running: df | grep -e "Mounted on" -e "/path/to/mountpoint".
