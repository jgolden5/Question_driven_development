What are 1-3 keywords that should come to mind when I think of df? mounted devices' disk
What does the df command do? views the amount of disk space currently being used and available on all mounted devices on my computer
Does the df command only check disk space on mounted devices? yes, that is what this command does
How would I show ONLY the filesystem names and their mountpoints using the df command? running: df | cut -c 1-15 -c 79- (in macOS)
How would I write a one-liner df command to display the available disk space on all mounted file systems in gigabytes, sorted by size? running the following command: df --block-size=1G | sort -k 2 | tac (linux only for tac)
How would I check disk usage across ALL partitions using the df command? running: df -h --total | tail -1 | sed -E 's/([^ ]+)( *)([^ ]+).*/\1: \3/' (use -c instead of --total and -r instead of -E for macOS)
How would I check the disk usage for only one specific mount point? running: df | grep -e "Mounted on" -e "/path/to/mountpoint"
What is an inode? a data structure that stores information about a file or directory in a unix-style filesystem; the info it contains includes file size, owner, permissions, timestamps, storage location, group, links (soft and hard), and the file's acl (access control list) [an inode seems to be the details of a file when the -l option is added to ls]
