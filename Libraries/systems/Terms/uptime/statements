The w command displays who is logged in and what they are doing, aka, displays uptime, and then processes that are running including specific amounts of time they have been idle, along with the name of the user the terminal is logged on for for said processes.
The might uptime command be important enough for Dad to want me to learn it, despite it being very simple and basic because systems-level debugging requires some time-series-type data scraping, which can be done with the uptime command letting me see how long certain the system has been running.
BESIDES tell how long the system has been running, uptime tells how many users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
For a process to be in an uninterruptible state means that it's sleeping (in other words, it's waiting for a resource that's not available yet), and in this state it cannot be interrupted by signals.
I would only show the system's uptime (without load averages or anything like that) by running: uptime -p OR uptime | sed -E 's/[^ ]+ ([^ ]+ [^ ]+ [^ ]+ [^ ]+) .*/1/'.
I would extract only the system's average load by running: uptime | sed 's/.*, (.*)/1/'.
I determine whether a system's load status average has exceeded a certain point by running: if [[ $(echo "$la < $limit" | bc -l) == 0 ]]; then echo "$limit was exceeded"; else echo "$limit was not exceeded"; fi; where $la = system load average, and $limit = whatever max limit I choose for load average.
