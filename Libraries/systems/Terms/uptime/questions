What does the w command do?
Why might the uptime command be important enough for Dad to want me to learn it, despite it being very simple and basic?
What does uptime do BESIDES tell how long the system has been running?
What does it mean for a process to be in an uninterruptible state?
How would I only show the system's uptime (without load averages or anything like that)?
How would I extract only the system's average load?
How do I determine whether a system's load status average has exceeded a certain point?
