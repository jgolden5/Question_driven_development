What is the purpose of CompoundDataClass? to provide definitions for calcultating inner dcbs and define dcb relationships, and to provide the requiredSetValues field and declare inner dc's based on what's in DCHolder
What is the purpose of LayeredDataClass? a little bit of baggage that was needed for the more complicated use case where we wanted multiple compoundDataClass instances to be independent of each other but still connect to other dataClasses as external dependencies; even though we don't need it now, we kept the feature because it's already implemented and we will likely need it again in the future
What is the calcInternal method used for in dataClass framework? basically acting as the a router to the specific calc functions pertaining to each dataClass
What are DCHolders used for? ensuring that all the dc's and df's only get instantiated once inside a specialized container (whatever class extends DCHolder, like CursorPositionDCHolder)
Why does pdcb.put() method clobber any possible conflicts? as far as the user is concerned, it doesn't matter which variable is set as long as enough variables are set in order to calculate the other one, since we aren't dealing with any crazy intense calculations, therefore it's just simpler to clobber any possible conflicts instead of repeating logic to prove there are none
What are dataForms for? literally storing the same data in different forms, like 1 can be represented as 1, 1.0, 1.000, one, or uno, depending on the context
What is pdcb.calcNeighbor() for? calculating a value not available by calculating the inners of the current outer dcb by going to a different outer of a neighboring pdcb, but an outer that IS complete, so that the missing pdcb can be calculated and the current odcb will be complete as well so that the pdcb that called calcNeighbor can ALSO be calculated
What is pdcb.cacheVal() for? setting a dcb's dataFormBrick
What is the purpose of PrimitiveDataClass? to constrain the dataForms allowed for the pdcb associated with the pdc, allowing for expected behavior (like with WholeNumberDC, for example, only certain dataForms will conform to it)
What is the purpose of DataClassBricks? to bind a data class' relationship (which is quite abstract) to a dataFormBrick (which is a concrete representation of something bound to a particluar dataForm)
