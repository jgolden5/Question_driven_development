What does @Nullable do in java? gives an explicit statement that the value might be null, so it instructs the programmer to use the variable in such a way that isn't as strict at checking for nullpointer exceptions, for example, and overall just keep in mind that that value has a purpose for being null sometimes
What happens if I remove inbound/outbound permitted from sockjsBridge? the required explicit permission for that event on the event bus to be listened to (inbound) or listened from (outbound) would not be given, and all events will fail to pass in those respective directions without said explicit permission
What does the AbstractVerticle class do in Vertx? is an easy way to write one's own Verticle, through the extension of this class and overriding the start(Promise) method
What is the purpose of rxjava3 in vertx? to be an external asynchronous library that cleanly aligns vertx with java (specifically in an observable way)
What is the purpose of SharedData in vertx? to allow you to share data safely between different parts of your application, using synchronous shared maps, as well as asynchronous maps, locks, and counters
What exactly does vertx rxjava's Router do? acts as a central hub for incoming http requests, receiving them from an HttpServer, and then directing each request to the first matching route it finds within its configuration
What is sockjs? a javascript library that attempts to accomplish what websockets accomplishes, but it may provide only half-duplex, near-duplex, or full-duplex depending on the transport used; for exaample, if sockjs uses websockets, it will be full duplex, whereas if it uses something else like xhr-streaming it will be limited but near full-duplex, and if it uses something like jsonp-polling or eventSource, it will only be half-duplex
What does java BufferedReader do? enhances the efficiency of reading character input streams, including files and network sockets, by reading large chunks of data into an internal buffer (aka. instead of reading one character at a time, it uses a BUFFER)
What does java InputStream do? serves as an abstract superclass for all classes that represent an input stream of bytes, providing a fundamental, consistent way to read data from a source, such as a file, network connection, or memory buffer, byte by byte; since it's an abstract class, it gets implemented by classe that use it, such as FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, or ByteArrayInputStream
What is java Collectors class used for? performing mutable reduction operations on streams, which involves accumulating elements from a stream into a result container, often transforming them in the process
What code makes MainVerticle get treated as main class? the Main-Class and Main-Verticle fields in the file ./build/tmp/shadowJar/MANIFEST.MF, where . represents the root directory of the project
What does it mean for vertx to deploy a verticle? it initiates and starts a running piece of vertx code called a verticle within the vertx runtime environment, allowing it to interact with other verticles asynchronously through the event bus and effectively execute as part of your application
What is vertx variable inside of AbstractVerticle? a reference to the vertx instance that deployed the verticle implementing AbstractVerticle
Is SockJSBridge native to vertx? yes, it is a builtin feature of vertx that allows you to bridge communication between the vertx event bus and web clients using the sockjs javascript library, enabling real-time messaging capabilities with your application
Is SockJSBridge native to vertx? yes, it's a core component that comes with vertx and doesn't require an external library to be added separately
What is a SockJSHandler? a component within a web application framework (like vertx) that allows you to manage and handle connections from clients using the sockjs protocol
What are the try and catch blocks in java used for? handling exceptions; try executes code, watching for any exceptions, and if an exception occurs, it executes code associated with said exception,, and the code can also have an optional finally block which gets executed after the try and catch blocks regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
What is a Thread class in java? a representation of a virtual sense of a position on which code is getting executed in multithreaded programming, which enables concurrent (asynchronous) execution of code on different "threads"
What is a lock in asynchronous programming? a mechanism used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions, even when multiple asynchronous operations are running concurrently
What is a counter in asynchronous programming? a variable that keeps track of the number of asynchronous operations that have been completed, and is often used to determine when all operations in a set have finished before proceeding to the next step in the program
What is the point of a jsonObject? to be a representation of a json object in java for formatting compatibility
What is a consumer in an event bus? an application, service, or component that actively listens for and receives events published on an event bus, essentially acting as a subscriber that processes the received data and performs actions based on it; in other words, it is the entity that "consumes" the events published by producers on the bus
What is the rxjava Message class used for? composing asynchronous, event-based programs by using observable sequences
Why do I always get multiple thread blocked errors when running my vertx app? whenever I use the debugger, it has to block my thread in order to step through code, because everything has been frozen in order to facilitate stepping through code, therefore, a vertx blocked thread error may only be ignored when I am debugging with breakpoints
What are BrickVisurVars used for in visur? basically just encapsulating the internal calculations of dataClassBricks and reducing the complexity to simple get/put functions
How do hashmaps work? following a general hash concept where a unique hash exists for every element in the hash map, and a key maps to the value at said hash, such that read and write operations are done with O(1) time complexity; hashmaps have an initial capacity and a load factor, and if the initial capacity times load factor exceeds the current number of elements in the hash map, the capacity roughly doubles
What was the purpose of implementing EditorContentService and EditorModelCoupler separately? to separate concerns regarding service classes, and bind them all together with the EditorModelCoupler so that the user would not need to worry about which services were going where, and that the services could each respectively pull in only the variables relative to them and there would not need to be a global structure to do this as there was back when EditorModelCoupler was EditorModelService
What is the purpose of LocalMap in vertx? to allow for a thread-safe, in-memory, map that allows you to share data between different parts of a single vertx instance, essentially acting as a local data cache, used to stored data that needs to be accessible across multiple verticles running on the same vertx instance
How does LocalMap relate with SharedData in vertx? the fact that SharedData is an interface which provides LocalMap
What is emc.getStrToMatch() used for in visur? finding the quantum limits by inching one character at a time towards the editor content length limit without exceeding that limit (note this is only used for RegexQuantum
Do event buses in vertx always listen at the url address /eventbus? no, the event bus is an internal messaging system for the vertx components, and when used on a network the endpoint url is configurable
Why are initializerInsertKeymap and InsertModeHandler separated with insertNewline being a function only in InsertModeHandler? I must have gotten confused; this has now been fixed
What is the time complexity of the InsertCharOp in visur? o(n) in the backend because of the nextLineIndices getting updated every time where n = the number of elements in nextLine array, and of course, o(n^2) on the front end because of the 2-dimensional canvas getting drawn
Why is InsertNewlineOp a longer function than InsertCharOp even though the actual newline is specified explicitly so in theory InsertNewlineOp should be shorter? ca has to get incremented in InsertNewlineOp and I also redundantly updated newlineChars even though that gets done inside the putEditorContent method which I also called,
What is a stream? a source of input abstracting away (hiding) another source--as long as the abstraction is not broken the code will be very flexible
What does observable mean? a data source that can emit multiple values over time, acting like a stream of data that can be subscribed to in order to receive updates whenever new values are produces; it iss essential to asynchronous programming
