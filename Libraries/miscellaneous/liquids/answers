How does RO water differ from DI water? Water gets pressurized through a semi-permeable membrane. Only pure water can pass through said membrane. This is because impure, non-water minerals are larger. Most ions are removed from DI water. DI water is ultra-clean and great for labs. RO is more nutritious water thank DI.
